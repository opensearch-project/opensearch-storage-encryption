/**
 * Per-IndexInput readahead context that manages sequential access detection and triggers async prefetch operations.
 * 
 * <p>This interface represents the state and behavior for a single file stream's readahead operations.
 * Each IndexInput gets its own context to track access patterns, detect sequential reads, and coordinate
 * with the readahead system for optimal prefetching.
 * 
 * <p>The context maintains internal state for:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Access pattern tracking:</strong> Records recent file offsets to detect sequential access</li>
 * <li><strong>Hit/miss statistics:</strong> Tracks cache performance to adapt readahead behavior</li>
 * <li><strong>Readahead policy:</strong> Associates with a policy that determines when and how much to prefetch</li>
 * <li><strong>State management:</strong> Provides reset and cancellation capabilities for lifecycle management</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations should be thread-safe for concurrent access from IndexInput operations.
